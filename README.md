# spotify-playlist-info
A website that shows the user information about their playlists.

### To-do list
- [x] ~~Implement state in index.js~~
- [x] ~~Fix bugs with the refreshing of the access token~~
- [ ] Validate that the user account/name details haven't changed whenever they log in
- [x] ~~Add support for playlists with no cover image (aka no songs on them)~~ Not show playlists with no songs on them
- [x] ~~Add error checking for pretty much every request~~
- [ ] Eventually migrate index.js to TypeScript
- [ ] Make sure everything complies with [Spotify's design guidelines](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/design)
- [x] ~~Change the font on the canvas to Inter so it matches the template~~
- [x] ~~Get all the positioning right on the canvas and make sure there's enough space for all the text~~
- [ ] Test the whole genre system
- [ ] (Very low priority and maybe not necessary) Improve text quality on the template
